### ClusterSubmitExternal.jl

ClusterSubmitExternal.jl is package for Julia intented to make it easy to submit 
"shell scripts" represented as Julia external commands on a HPC cluster.


This is a naive bare-bones approach. Unlike
 [ClusterManagers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/ClusterManagers.jl),
 which supports full distributed julia code and relies on starting remote
 workers, this approach it is _only_ intended 
to run Julia encapsulated _external commands_ (shell commands ) on a HPC cluster and does this through the cluster queue management software directly rather than through Julia workers. It works by translating the Julia encapsulated external commands
to a shell script with suitable directives for the queue submission system. 


Currently, only Sun Grid Engine is supported, but in the future other cluster
managements systems may be supported too.

### Example usage:

Considering the [pipeline example from the Julia manual](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/running-external-programs/#pipelines)

```julia
myjob=pipeline(`do_work`, stdout=pipeline(`sort`, "out.txt"), stderr="errs.txt")
```

External commands like these, can via this package be submitted run as a cluster job using the `qsub` function,

```julia
jobid=qsub(myjob)
```

This not block, but will immediately return the `jobid`. Usually, this is what is wanted since such jobs
may be rather time-consuming. However, to wait for the job to finish, we can use `qwait` which blocks until 
the job finished, e.g., 

```julia
qwait(jobid)
```

Note that `qwait` currently does not provide any indication of whether the job was successfully run, and will, e.g.,
not block nor complain if called on a non-existing Â´jobid`. 

It is also possible to specify dependencies, i.e., jobs that must finish before another can commence, and to parse arbitrary options to `qsub` like in the example below:

```julia
jobid=qsub(myjob2, depends=[myjob1], options=["-l pe smp 4"])
```
